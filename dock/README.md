ThinkPad Dock
=============

These are the hook scripts I am using for my ThinkPad Dock. They are a work in progress in some parts and are steadily improved as I see fit.
They take care of monitor configuration, sound, keyboard etc.

The scripts are very specific for my personal use; you will probably want to adjust a lot of things when using them (especially the xrandr stuff), or only use some snippets.
